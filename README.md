 Type the below command in a terminal 
 to install package that provides beep sound

 sudo apt install sox

### Usage
Run the below command in your python environment:
\npython tomato_srj.py
\nprompt expects either "start" or "break" from user
1. start
: Typing start will begin the timer and beeps after 25 minutes.
2. break
: Typing break will start a break of 5 minute interval.

\n\nIn both the above options, screen will be cleared and program exits after 3 beeps.
\nWe have to manually run again to restart.
